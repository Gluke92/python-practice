Q. What is *args, and what is *kwargs?
If you want multiple paramters, or multiple keywords in yoru function, you can use * to indicate that more than one argument, or keyword, is expected.

Paramters are arguments we pass in to the function at definition. Arguments are passed in when the function is called. *args indicates that the function, when called, will take multiple arguments. *kwargs indicates that the function can be assigned multiple key-value pairs when called.
